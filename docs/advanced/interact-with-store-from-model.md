# Advanced: Interact With Store From Model

Alternative for calling store methods directly, you may access store instance from a model as well to dispatch actions or call getters.

```js
const user = User.dispatch('create', { data: ... })

// The above code is exactly same as below.

const user = store.dispatch('entities/users/create', { data: ... })
```

Accessing store from a model does nothing special compared to accessing the store directly. It's just for the convenience. Hence you may choose whichever way that fits your preference.

## Accessing Store Instance

You can access store instance via `store` method.

```js
// As static method.

const store = User.store()

// As instance method.

const user = new User()

const store = user.$store()
```

### Dispatching Action

You can dispatch an action via `dispatch` method. Dispatch method in the model will automatically call be namespaced, so you don't have to pass in root namespace or entity name as an argument.

```js
// As static method.

User.dispatch('create', { data: ... })

// As instance method.

const user = new User()

user.$dispatch('create', { data: ... })
```

As you can see, in above example we didn't call dispatch action as `entities/users/create` because the `entities/users` part is generated by the model.

### Calling Getters

You can call getters via `getters` method. Be aware that getters in the model should be called as a method, not array accessing syntax.

```js
// As static method.

const user = User.getters('find')(1)

// As instance method.

const user = new User()

const users = user.$getters('all')()
```

As same as actions, getters in the model is also namespaced automatically.
