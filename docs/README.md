# Vuex ORM

Vuex ORM is a plugin for [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) to enable Object-Relational Mapping like access to the Vuex Store. Heavily inspired by Redux recipe of ["Normalizing State Shape"](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/NormalizingStateShape.html) and ["Updating Normalized Data"](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/UpdatingNormalizedData.html).

Vuex ORM lets you create "normalized" data schema within Vuex Store and provide fluent API to get, search and update Store state.
