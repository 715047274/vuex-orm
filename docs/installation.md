# Installation

You can install Vuex ORM via NPM or Yarn. Remember since Vuex ORM is a plugin of Vuex, you need to install Vuex along side with Vuex ORM.

## NPM

```console
$ npm install vuex vuex-orm --save
```

## Yarn

```console
$ yarn add vuex vuex-orm
```

## Dev Build

You will have to clone directly from GitHub and build vuex yourself if you want to use the latest dev build.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/revolver-app/vuex-orm.git node_modules/vuex-orm
$ cd node_modules/vuex-orm
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
